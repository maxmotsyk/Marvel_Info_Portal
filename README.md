# Marvel Info Portal

If you are a Marvel fan or want to learn about this Universe, I believe this web application will be interesting and even useful to you. It provides various functionalities related to Marvel heroes and comics.

## Functionality

- Generates random heroes from the Marvel Universe with their images and brief descriptions.
- Displays a list of 9 heroes with the ability to load more heroes (the API provides access to a total of 1543 characters).
- Provides information about the comics in which a hero appeared, including the year of release and comic series, along with a brief character description.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Fetch requests

## Development Details

During the development, class components were utilized along with a system for loading heroes. Error boundaries were implemented to prevent component failures in case of rendering or server request issues. Prop type checking was also incorporated using PropTypes.

The Marvel Developer Portal API ([https://developer.marvel.com/](https://developer.marvel.com/))  was used to fetch data for this web application. The API provides a vast amount of information, various search options, and detailed documentation.

Feel free to explore the web application and dive into the Marvel Universe!
